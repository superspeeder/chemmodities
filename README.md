Chemmodities True Version. Particle Simulated Chemistry inspired by Noita

## Building From Source

Building requires 7zip and cmake.

Run `scripts/write_config.py` with python 3.x and follow the prompts.

Next, make sure the working directory of the terminal is in the `scripts` folder. After doing that, run either `build_all.bat` or `clean_build_all.bat`. Normal `build_all.bat` doesn't clean the build directory, but `clean_build_all.bat` will.

The output goes into the `output` folder, which is zipped into `game.zip`

## Future Additions

library only build scripts.
linux & osx build scripts.
